'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up<br>
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round every party in LA<br>
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh<br>

"How Would You Feel (Paean)"<br>
<br><br>
You are the one girl<br>
And you know that it's true<br>
I'm feeling younger<br>
Every time that I'm alone with you<br>
<br><br>
We were sitting in a parked car<br>
Stealing kisses in the front yard<br>
We got questions we should not ask but<br>
<br><br>
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?<br>
It's just something that I want to do<br>
I'll be taking my time, spending my life<br>
Falling deeper in love with you<br>
So tell me that you love me too<br>
<br><br>
In the summer, as the lilacs bloom<br>
Love flows deeper than the river<br>
Every moment that I spend with you<br>
We were sat upon our best friend's roof<br>
I had both of my arms round you<br>
Watching the sunrise replace the moon<br>
<br><br>
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?<br>
It's just something that I want to do<br>
I'll be taking my time, spending my life<br>
Falling deeper in love with you<br>
So tell me that you love me too<br>
<br><br>

"A Star Is Born Medley: Shallow / Always Remember Us This Way"<br>
<br><br>
Tell me somethin' girl<br>
Are you happy in this modern world?<br>
Or do you need more?<br>
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?<br>
I'm falling<br>
<br><br>
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes<br>
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire<br>
It's buried in my soul like California gold<br>
You found the light in me that I couldn't find<br>
<br><br>
So when I'm all choked up<br>
And I can't find the words<br>
Every time we say goodbye<br>
Baby, it hurts<br>
<br><br>
And I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in<br>
And I'll never meet the ground<br>
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us<br>
We're far from the shallow now<br>
<br>
When the sun goes down<br>
And the band won't play<br>
I'll always remember us this way<br>
<br><br>
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low<br>
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low<br>
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low<br>
We're far from the shallow now<br>
<br><br>
When you look at me<br>
And the whole world fades<br>
I'll always remember us this way<br>
<br><br>
We're far from the shallow now<br>
